Expression blend shape for the 16759 shape model
---
The expression blendshapes for the 16759 model (expression_blendshapes_16759.bin) seem to produce
faulty shapes, see: https://github.com/patrikhuber/4dface/issues/12. Until the issue has been fixed
users are advised not to use this particular file.

All other blendshapes are fine.
